    <p> I believe in my ability to be the hero of my life and the undefeatable warrior of my dreams.I've faced deep adversity, unexpected tragedies and uncommon blows. Yet, something inside of me has pressed on.I have turned my wounds into wisdom, my pain into power and my defeats into stepping stones for greater confidence, performance, and helpfulness.</p>

I have learned to be relentless, selfless and dedicated through being their fun for years and no wonder its <strong> more than a club</strong> </p>
